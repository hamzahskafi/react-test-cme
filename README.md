This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App]


You can clone the repo from https://github.com/hamzahskafi/react-test-cme

Make sure to create a .env file with the environment variable REACT_APP_API_KEY containing your youtube api key,
otherwise the search method will not work.
Alternatively, you can introduce the key as a golbal configuration variable if you choose to deploy remotely (Heroku, Vercel etc...).


You can find a working environment deployed directly from the aforementioned repository on:
https://react-test-cme.vercel.app/
