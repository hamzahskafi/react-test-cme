This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App]


You can clone the repo from https://github.com/hamzahskafi/react-test-cme

Make sure to create a .env file with the environment variable REACT_APP_API_KEY containing your youtube api key,
otherwise the search method will not work.
Alternatively, you can introduce the key as a golbal configuration variable if you choose to deploy remotely (Heroku, Vercel etc...).


You can find a working environment deployed directly from the aforementioned repository on:
https://react-test-cme.vercel.app/


Once the api-key has been defined, use the terminal/cmd/powershell to execute the command

npm install

to install dependencies, followed by the command

npm start

which will deploy the app locally in a development environment.
